### Hi there 👋, I'm Bibek Gurung

I am a Software developer, living in London. Front-end development is my specialty but I'm also open to full-stack development 🚀.

My expertise lie in, but not limited to,  **JavaScript/TypeScript** and **React/React Native** with **Redux**. I have also gained experience in Express, Mongo and Mongoose for the back-end side of programming. My knowledge in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects nicely rounds up my design skills and compliments my front-end development skills 😎.

When I am not programming, I find myself enjoying activities like Basketball🏀, Swimming🏊‍♀️, Animation🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️ and Video Editing📽 to name a few.
